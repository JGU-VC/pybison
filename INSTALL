INSTALL file for PyBison

1. Prerequisites

You will need:

  - Python 3.6 or later, with development headers and libraries
  - for linux:
    - GNU bison (or yacc) - www.gnu.org or gnuwin32.sf.net
    - GNU flex (or lex) - ditto
  - for windows:
    winflexbison: https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/tree/master/bin/Release
  - Cython Python/C wrapper creation framework:
      - http://cython.org
  - A standard C compiler and linker

2. Installing

  - Crack the tarball somewhere convenient (eg your home directory)
  - cd into the top level directory of this package
  - become root, and type 'python setup.py install'

With all going well, you should see a bunch of harmless warning messages
from the compilation of bison.c, but no errors.

The following commands will verify if the installation succeeded:

  $ which bison2py
  /usr/bin/bison2py
  $ python -c "import bison"
  $
